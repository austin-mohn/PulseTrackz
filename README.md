# PulseTrackz üéµüö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Overview
PulseTrackz is a machine learning-driven tool that automates playlist creation for spin classes by classifying songs based on their audio features into workout segments like warm-up, sprint, climb, interval, and cool-down. This project aims to eliminate the manual burden of playlist curation while enhancing fitness experiences through dynamic, personalized music alignment.

## Problem Statement 
Fitness instructors often struggle with crafting the perfect music flow for spin classes. Traditional playlist creation is subjective, time-consuming, and doesn‚Äôt scale well. PulseTrackz bridges this gap by leveraging song features from Spotify to automatically generate phase-specific playlists optimized for physical exertion patterns.
